# Drawing

The act of drawing is meaningful to me. As long as I can remember, I have worked through ideas on paper with pen or pencil, manifesting my inner world of ideas externally for anyone to experience. I have imagined and rendered countless characters and imaginary worlds. I have used drawing to understand, bring clarity to my thinking, and slow down as I look at the world around me. It provides an opportunity to notice universes within the most mundane detail.

Until recently, I have considered drawing a profoundly human act. Something maybe some Elephants or Monkeys can attempt, but which requires something unique to homo sapiens. However, this is not the case. DAL-E and other AI-based tools produce stunning drawings that rival human artists. These tools rely on prompts from us and draw upon the collective imagination of the web.
