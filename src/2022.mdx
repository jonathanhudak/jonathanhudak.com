# 2022

- Alive and well on Bainbridge Island, Wa.
- Senior Frontend Engineer at Amazon Web Services
- Learning techniques of japanese joinery, and wood carving.
- Creating art and music and not sharing it much.
- Playing nostalgic 90's rock songs on my old acoustic guitar while my son Theodore builds with lego bricks.
