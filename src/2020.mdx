# 2020

This was quite a strange year for me as I am sure it was for everyone on planet Earth.

## Move to Bainbridge Island, Washington

During Covid times, Seattle got to be a drag so we moved across the Puget Sound to Bainbridge Island. My only complaint about living on the island is the limited array of restaurants. Otherwise it has been beautiful and quiet. We have been able to explore the Olympic Penninsula and enjoy more of my home State.
